Description:

This ePortfolio showcases my project for Software Engineering (CS317) at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines, Cagayan de Oro (USTP CDO). The project demonstrates my ability to apply software development skills in a structured and practical environment. It was developed as part of the course requirements under the supervision of our professor and reflects various stages of software engineering principles, including design, implementation, and deployment.

For the development, I have taken inspiration from one of our fellow developers such as John Lloyd Omblero and Nisar.
    Utilized my existing understanding HTML, CSS for our frontend while also having a little bit of experience for the little backend using Javascript. 
    We then have utilized extensions in VSCode for the Live viewing and changes of the development of the ePortfolio as well as following through the instructions of 
    Maam Raniah Taurac in deploying our application through GitHub Pages. Aside from that for the contact section, have utilized formspree as it is the most simplest
    and most basic contacting section available for beginners.

Interactivity using JS:

    Hamburger menu - used for when the screen is at below a certain limit.
    Back to top button - used for when the user scrolls down the page.
    Contact form - used for when the user clicks the contact button.

List of Technologies Used:

    HTML – To structure and organize web page content effectively.
    CSS – For designing a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
    JavaScript – To implement interactive features and dynamic content.
    Live Server – To run the project using the extension live server.
    GitHub – To host the project and manage version control.
    FormSpree - Emailing the ePortfolio developer.

Instructions for Replication:

    1. Make sure you have a code editor like VS Code installed on your machine.
    2. You should have Node.js installed on your machine.
    3. As well as Git installed on your machine.
    4. Connect your GitHub account to your local machine.
    5. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    6. Open the project in your code editor.
    7. Run the project using the extension live server.

For Contribution:

    1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
    2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
    3. Make your changes to the code.
    4. Commit your changes.
    5. Push your changes to your branch.
    6. Create a pull request to the original repository.
